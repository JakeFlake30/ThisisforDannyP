        <div class="caption">   I'm actually so sad that I'm not going to be around for the actual birthday day but like such is life. My guys already planned how we'll stop over after church for lunch. Sigh.
          Words alone cannot express how much of an impact you have had in my life and how helpful you have been. You are such a wonderful friend and you deserve the best in life. 
          You are one of the strongest people I know. Obviously not in literal physical strength. You're a weakling. But in like resilience. You have gone through so much in these past 16years and even though you breakdown ( often), you always pick yourself right up.
          Thank you so much for being a part of my life and enduring me and my terrible English. Thank you for all your help, guidance and assistance. 
           Happy Birthday Danyelinnaaaa. May God continue to keep, guide and protect you. Amen.
          I hope you enjoy your day. Make sure you eat o. I'll find ways to communicate from school. 
     
     Your Nemesis,
     Chiziterem.

          You are so a wonderful person; beautiful on both the outside and inside, 
          Only those that are close to you will understand how caring you are.
          I still have those precious notes you randomly wrote to me when you felt like you went doing enough to keep US,
          See you get what I mean lemme not spill much of the tea 🫖 
          I am in school right now as you may know.
          But I will also have you know that I hope this day is a wonderful and delightful day for you,
          I hope that you enjoy every bit of the day (especially since it’s not in school🤠🥹🫣),
          I just want you to know that ily 🤟 😘 and nobody (and I mean NOBODY 👀) can steal you from me,
          See I wanted to do voice note because I don’t like typing too much but he has forced me to type so O just have to keep on going,

            I hope life does you justice for how good of a person you are to others. Please don't stop being a positive influence to everyone around you.

      I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how incredibly proud I am of you.
       You've come so far in this Netflix show of a life you have,
        and it's amazing to see all that you've accomplished. 
       I'm so happy that we get to celebrate another year of your wonderful life. 
       Keep shining and achieving great things.

    <div class="caption">Happy Birthday Danyelle,
      It took a lot of time and energy to make this,
      But I hope it compensates for all the time and energy I wasn’t able to give you during this holiday.
      You are…indescribable.
      You are not just the smartest person I’ve ever met, but also the strongest.
      At a point last term, I would wake up thanking God that I was able to meet someone like you,
      You might not think so. But it really is true.
      Thank You for all the effort, I see it and I appreciate it.
      You deserve so much. So much that I feel like this little thing I made is simply not enough.
      You are the most complex person I’ve ever met. You make me THINK without overthinking and I really really like that about you.
      I hope you liked the website. I really do.
      I promise, I can and will do some much more if I could.
      Happy Birthday.
