          Words alone cannot express how much of an impact you have had in my life and how helpful you have been. You are such a wonderful friend and you deserve the best in life. 
          You are one of the strongest people I know. Obviously not in literal physical strength. You're a weakling. But in like resilience. You have gone through so much in these past 16years and even though you breakdown ( often), you always pick yourself right up.
          Thank you so much for being a part of my life and enduring me and my terrible English. Thank you for all your help, guidance and assistance. 
           Happy Birthday Danyelinnaaaa. May God continue to keep, guide and protect you. Amen.
          I hope you enjoy your day. Make sure you eat o. I'll find ways to communicate from school. 
     
     Your Nemesis,
     Chiziterem.

      I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how incredibly proud I am of you.
       You've come so far in this Netflix show of a life you have,
        and it's amazing to see all that you've accomplished. 
       I'm so happy that we get to celebrate another year of your wonderful life. 
       Keep shining and achieving great things.

    <div class="caption">Happy Birthday Danyelle,
      It took a lot of time and energy to make this,
      But I hope it compensates for all the time and energy I wasnâ€™t able to give you during this holiday.
      You areâ€¦indescribable.
      You are not just the smartest person Iâ€™ve ever met, but also the strongest.
      At a point last term, I would wake up thanking God that I was able to meet someone like you,
      You might not think so. But it really is true.
      Thank You for all the effort, I see it and I appreciate it.
      You deserve so much. So much that I feel like this little thing I made is simply not enough.
      You are the most complex person Iâ€™ve ever met. You make me THINK without overthinking and I really really like that about you.
      I hope you liked the website. I really do.
      I promise, I can and will do some much more if I could.
      Happy Birthday.
