    I'm actually so sad that I'm not going to be around for the actual birthday day but like such is life. My guys already planned how we'll stop over after church for lunch. Sigh.
     Words alone cannot express how much of an impact you have had in my life and how helpful you have been. You are such a wonderful friend and you deserve the best in life. 
     You are one of the strongest people I know. Obviously not in literal physical strength. You're a weakling. But in like resilience. You have gone through so much in these past 16years and even though you breakdown ( often), you always pick yourself right up.
     Thank you so much for being a part of my life and enduring me and my terrible English. Thank you for all your help, guidance and assistance. 
      Happy Birthday Danyelinnaaaa. May God continue to keep, guide and protect you. Amen.
     I hope you enjoy your day. Make sure you eat o. I'll find ways to communicate from school. 

Your Nemesis,
Chiziterem

            You are so a wonderful person; beautiful on both the outside and inside, 
            Only those that are close to you will understand how caring you are.
            I still have those precious notes you randomly wrote to me when you felt like you went doing enough to keep US,
            See you get what I mean lemme not spill much of the tea ðŸ«– 
            I am in school right now as you may know.
            But I will also have you know that I hope this day is a wonderful and delightful day for you,
            I hope that you enjoy every bit of the day (especially since itâ€™s not in schoolðŸ¤ ðŸ¥¹ðŸ«£),
            I just want you to know that ily ðŸ¤Ÿ ðŸ˜˜ and nobody (and I mean NOBODY ðŸ‘€) can steal you from me,
            See I wanted to do voice note because I donâ€™t like typing too much but he has forced me to type so O just have to keep on going,
            Love you as always girl my madame DP Moore ðŸŒ¸ðŸ«¡
